## Tools for the Wikisouce's Anniversary Proofreading Contest

`wscontest` is a collection of tools for running the Wikisouceâ€™s Anniversary Proofreading Contest in your local Wikisource (Wikisource Anniversary Proofreading Contest, WAPC).

### What is it?

The Wikisource Anniversary Proofreading Contest is a competition held annually on Wikisource in November, during the contest people can help [proofread](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Help:Proofread) and [validate](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Help:Beginner%27s_guide_to_validation) book pages on Wikisouce. For each page either proofread or validated the participant gain points.
At the end of the contest, a prize is awarded to the Wikisourcian with the most points. Second and third-place prize are awarded with a random drawing from all the remaining contestants: each point that you gained during the contest is like a lottery ticket, so the more points you have gained during the contest (that is, the more pages you have proofread or validated), the more chances you have to win.

## Tools

`wscontest` consists of three main parts:
* the `votecounter` scripts, to count the points for each contestant;
* the `ranking` script, to designate the winner (who has the most points) and to draw the second and third-place winners;
* this website ([wscontest/website](https://github.com/wscontest/website));
